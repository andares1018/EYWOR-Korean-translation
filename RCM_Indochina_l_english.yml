 ###LEADER DESCS###
 POLITICS_JEAN_DECOUX_DESC:0 "Born in 1884 in Bordeaux, Jean Decoux entered the École Navale in 1901, and served across the world before commanding the submarine \"Volta\" during the Great War. Promoted rear admiral in 1935, he was part of the French delegation at the London Naval Conference, and then held various commands in the Mediterranean. Recently designed Commander-in-Chief of the Naval Forces in the Far East alongside its promotion to vice-admiral, he has now been appointed by Pétain's government as Governor-General of Indochina, the first naval officer to hold the post since 1879.\nNow commanding Indochina, a ship made of five states, it seems that even the task of preserving french sovereignty over the region will be difficult." 
 
 POLITICS_RENE_ROBIN_DESC:0 "An associate of the colonial reformer Albert Sarraut, René Robin served nearly thirty years as an administrator in Indochina, holding important posts such as General Secretary of the Indochinese Union between 1921 and 1925, and Resident-Superior of Tonkin from 1925 to 1930. Governor-General since Pierre Pasquier's death in a plane crash in 1934, Robin pursued the policies of Sarraut like its predecessors did. He is, however, unpopular as the native population associate him with the repression that occured after the Yen Bai mutiny. It now clearly appears that, if France wants to change its policy in Indochina, René Robin will have to go."
 
 POLITICS_JULES_BREVIE_DESC:0 "Former Governor-General of French West Africa, Jules Brévié advocated there for a policy of scientific and humanist colonization, seeking to understand indigenous people in order to apply a successful native policy.\nAppointed Governor-General of Indochina by the Popular Front, the liberal-minded, socialist Brévié will have the difficult task of managing the colonial unrest, while redressing the ailing economy."
 
 POLITICS_GEORGES_CATROUX_DESC:0 "After his military formation, Georges Catroux served in Algeria and Indochina. During the Great War, he was was taken prisoner by the Germans, and while in captivity met Charles De Gaulle. He continued his military career during the pacification of Syria, and became a five-star general. Now Governor-General of Indochina, the first non-civilian to hold the post since the end of the conquest, Georges Catroux will have to organize the defence of the peninsula, no matter what meager means he has."

 FIC_friendly_invasion_desc:0 "Due to the recently signed Tripartite Pact between the German Reich and Japan, the Japanese Empire should be our friend instead of enemy. However, they are now using that fact against us and preparing an attack on the Indochinese Peninsula. Knowing that if they launch an offensive operation against Indochina Germany mostly likely won't even care, despite our allegiance towards its ally, Germany."

While the agreement guarantees the territorial integrity of Indochin, this makes us, although we are neutral, a key supporter of the japanese war effort."

 #Naval
 FIC_submarine_1:0 "600 Series"
 FIC_submarine_1_desc:0 "The 600-ton Series of submarines were France's first modern post WWI submarines. They were medium sized, displacing around 600tons. Though they were seagoing ones, they were designated as coastal submarines and used mostly in warm waters of the Mediterranean. Three classes of 4 ships each built of this type: Sirène, Ariane and Circé classes. They were the basis of the bigger 630-ton Series the Argonaute, Diane and Orion classes."
 #FIC_submarine_1b: "630 Series"
 #FIC_submarine_1c: "Redoutable Class"
 FIC_submarine_2:0 "Minerve Class"
 FIC_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardization program resulting of a centralized design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 #FIC_submarine_2b: "Aurore Class"
 FIC_submarine_3:0 "Roland Morillot Class"
 FIC_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Roland Morillot-class submarines (Project name Z2) were large ocean going submarines based on the earlier Redoubtable-class submarines. They were large submarines displacing 1,800-2,400 tons and carried a formidable armament of 10 torpedo tubes. The Fall of France occurred before any were finished."
 FIC_submarine_4:0 "Phénix Class"
 FIC_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 FIC_destroyer_1:0 "Bourrasque Class"
 FIC_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Bourrasque-class destroyers were part of the 1,500-ton Series, and launched in the mid 1920's. Together with the preceding Chacal and following L'Adroit classes, they were the backbone of the new modern post war French fleet. They were fast and well-armed for their time, but their torpedo armament is smaller compared to similar vessels in the other navies."
 #FIC_destroyer_1b: "Chacal Class"
 #FIC_destroyer_1c: "Aigle & Vauquelin Class"
 FIC_destroyer_2:0 "Le Fantasque Class"
 FIC_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval program. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 #FIC_destroyer_2b: "Le Hardi Class"
 #FIC_destroyer_2c: "Mogador Class"
 FIC_destroyer_3:0 "L'Intrépide Class"
 FIC_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers ware a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focused more on an anti-aircraft role, and had an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons had larger engines."
 FIC_destroyer_4:0 "Hoche Class"
 FIC_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorized in the 1939-40 naval programs but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 FIC_light_cruiser_1:0 "Duguay-Trouin Class"
 FIC_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval program. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armor."
 FIC_light_cruiser_2:0 "La Galissonnière Class"
 FIC_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programs, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 FIC_light_cruiser_3:0 "De Grasse Class"
 FIC_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorized in the 1938 and 1939 naval programs and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 FIC_light_cruiser_4:0 "Colbert Class"
 FIC_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armor, and was slightly smaller."
 FIC_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Suffren Class"
 FIC_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armor but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 FIC_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Algérie Class"
 FIC_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armor belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 FIC_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Saint Louis Class"
 FIC_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armor would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 FIC_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Forbin Class"
 FIC_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Forbin-class heavy cruisers were a hypothetical design as a follow up of the Saint Louis class. Designed to defend the trade lanes between Mainland France and the colonies, it had long range and good speed along with a heavy armament of guns in four triple turrets and an adequate number of AA weaponry. The ship layout and general look resembled an influence from the previous Saint Louis class as well as British Crown Colony class."
 FIC_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Durand-Viel Design"
 FIC_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armored than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 FIC_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Dunkerque Class"
 FIC_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 FIC_battleship_1:0 "Courbet Class"
 FIC_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 #FIC_battleship_1b: "Bretagne Class"
 FIC_battleship_2:0 "Richelieu Class"
 FIC_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FIC_battleship_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 FIC_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 FIC_battleship_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 FIC_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armor plates, and larger engines."
 FIC_SH_battleship_1:0 "Charlemagne Class"
 FIC_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armor. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 FIC_SH_battleship_2:0 "Napoléon Bonaparte Class"
 FIC_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armor and strong engines provide the speed and defense needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 FIC_carrier_1:0 "Béarn Class"
 FIC_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 FIC_carrier_2:0 "Joffre Class"
 FIC_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 FIC_carrier_3:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 FIC_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 FIC_carrier_4:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 FIC_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."
